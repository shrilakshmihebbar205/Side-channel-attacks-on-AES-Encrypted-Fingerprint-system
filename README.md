# Side-channel-attacks-on-AES-Encrypted-Fingerprint-system
A model is considered where fingerprint images are encrypted using AES Encryption algorithm. two side channel attacks namely Timing analysis attack and Cache attack are performed. A modified approach is proposed to enhance the security of the system.
